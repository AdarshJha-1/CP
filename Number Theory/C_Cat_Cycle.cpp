Initially I understood by visualizing that I have to somehow find the number of collisions.

A move index-- and B move index++, so I thought collision is the main thing here.

Then after dry runs I got the formula that for a given n, collision happens at every:
(n - 1) / 2

moves.

Then I thought I should also calculate how many total collisions can happen given I can move only k times.
Then I realized I actually have only k - 1 moves because move 1 is just the initial value position and no movement happens there.

So I thought:

collisions = (k - 1) / collision_interval

Initially after this I became blank because no approach came into my mind for the final answer.

Then later I understood that B position is basically:

normal moves + collisions

Because:

even if collision does not happen, B still moves +1 every hour
 so normal movement is always:

k - 1


Then whenever collision happens, B gets shifted one extra +1.

So total movement of B becomes:
(k - 1) + collisions

Then I got confused at the end while finding the actual position of B after all iterations.

For even n:

 collision never happens
 so B and A just move normally every hour

So answer is basically movement after k - 1 moves.

Then I understood that movement can exceed the n range because positions are circular.

So % n wraps it back to the actual position in the position array.

Same for odd n:

 B normally moves +1 every hour
 except when collision happens, then B moves one extra +1

So for odd n:

 first get interval when collision occurs
 then calculate under k - 1 hours how many collisions can happen
 all these collisions affect B position
 so B gets:

+ total_collisions

extra movement.

Then normal movement which happens regardless of collision is:

k - 1

So total movement becomes:

(k - 1) + total_collisions

Then this can exceed the n range, so % n wraps it.

Then I understood why +1 is needed.

Because % n gives values in:

0 to n - 1

which is basically 0-based indexing.

But problem positions are:

1 to n

so final answer becomes:
((k - 1 + collisions) % n) + 1

I think my overall logic building and formulas were mostly correct.
I was mainly getting confused at the ending part while translating total movement into the actual final position of B.
